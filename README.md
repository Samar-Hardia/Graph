# Graph
The Plotters aims at providing on the go charts and graphs with use of java libraries.
It provides an easy to use graphical interface through which users can create, view,
publish and store data online.
➢ The Plotters is a web application (J2EE) and provides an interface to view charts and
graphs and save them using MySQL server. The information provided by user is
provided through user interface or via a CSV or an excel file.
➢ This is a Multi-Tiered application with layers inter-mediating between the user and
the web application server these layers are abstractions of the operation logic. These
abstractions are done using components. Java Server Pages (JSP) bridges the whole
operation between the user and services.
➢ The database is a RDBMS (Relational database management system) with high level
of security and authentication. The database connection and operation are performed
using JDBC (Java to Database connectivity).
➢ The project uses java library JFreeChart which is a free open source java chart library
used to display professional quality chart in any application. It provides flexible
application at both client and server side. We can also create real-time charts by using
java multi-threading as JFreeChart support high rate of updates.
➢ Application provides option for users to register and save their graphs and charts. The
login information is maintained throughout the user&#39;s system using session. The
registered user has to enter login information (username and password) and if user
information is correct he can view data he/she has saved.
➢ The application also provides option to directly mail the chart using java mail api or
download this in user&#39;s system in different image formats.
